			<section>
				<p>IP addresses are numbers that allow computers to share messages with eachother. Nevertheless,
				they have been subverted into being personally identifiable. This is unfair to users.</p>
				<p>This website is an attempt to fix that. By making random web requests, this website
				may leak your IP address to random third-parties. Nevertheless, this is not going to harm your
				computer.</p>
				<p>In an ideal world, IP addresses would only identify individual requests. This is completely
				technically feasible, and systems like "i2p" do it all the time. Unfortunately, those technologies
				aren't easily accessible to your average user. We believe we can still get there however. It's
				never too late to start prioritizing privacy.</p>
				<p>This page has a 3 minute cooldown before sending the requests, in case you don't wanna do that.
				You're welcome.</p>
